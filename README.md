## Global Word Representaion provided by Facebook AI Research!



This repo shows the implementaion of loading the word embeddings into Keras model for Azerbaijani language in R and Python noteboooks.

Note: In Python notebook only Mac and Linux users will be able to clone and run the example because __data.table__ is not available for Windows users.

We will add an additonal method for Windows users, as well but later.

Word embeddings were trained by Facebook Research.
